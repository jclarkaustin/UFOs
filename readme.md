# UFOs

## Overview of Project

This project uses json files and Java script to display a filterable table of UFO sightings.

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to provide Dana with a dynamic table that she can use to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings.

## Results

- Using json files, a css file, and an html page the data is easily read and filtered.

## Summary

- While it does make the data easier to read, the format is simple and limited. 
- The page could have a chart or two or plotting of sightings so that people can get an idea of where sightings are occuring most.
